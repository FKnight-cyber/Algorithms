/*
Add a Copy Constructor to an Existing Class
Given the Dog class defined in Dog.h, add a Copy constructor.

The copy constructor should copy the attributes from one object to another.
Also, please display, "Copy Constructor" to cout in the body of your copy constructor. 
Do not follow the output statement with '\n' or endl

The copy constructor should allow us to create  Dog objects as follows:

Dog spot {"Spot", 5};   // Overloaded constuctor
Dog twin {spot};        // Copy constructor, twin will be a copy of spot


Please add your code to the Dog.h file.

You can find my solution by clicking on the solution.txt file on the left pane. 
But please make sure you give it a go yourself first, and only check the solution if 
you really get stuck.
