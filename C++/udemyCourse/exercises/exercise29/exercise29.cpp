/*
Adding public methods that access private class attributes
Given the following Dog class in Dog.h add the following public getter and setter 
methods that get and set each class attribute as follows:

get_name returns the name attribute of the dog 

set_name sets the name attribute of the dog to the string that is passed into the method.

get_age returns the age attribute of the dog

set_age sets the age attribute of the dog to the int passed into the method.

Please add your code to the Dog.h file. The exercise.cpp file should NOT be modified.

You can find my solution by clicking on the solution.txt file on the left pane. But please 
make sure you give it a go yourself first, and only check the solution if you really get stuck.
