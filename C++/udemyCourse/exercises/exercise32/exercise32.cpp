/*
Add an Overloaded Constructor to an Existing Class
Given the Dog class defined in Dog.h, add an overloaded constructor 
that expect a std::string and int as parameters.

The constructor should allow us to create  Dog objects as follows:

Dog fido {"Fido", 4};
Dog spot {"Spot", 5};
Please add your code to the Dog.h file.

You can find my solution by clicking on the solution.txt file on the left pane. 
But please make sure you give it a go yourself first, and only check the solution 
if you really get stuck.
