/*
Add a Default Constructor to an Existing Class
Given the Dog class in Dog.h, add a default no-args constructor that initializes the dog's 
name to "None" and the dog's age to zero.

Please add your code to the Dog.h file.

You can find my solution by clicking on the solution.txt file on the left pane. But please
make sure you give it a go yourself first, and only check the solution if you really get stuck.
